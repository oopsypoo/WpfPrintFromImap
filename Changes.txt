1.	I copied the code from a test-program and forgot to remove the initialization of the variables locally. The variables are member-variables og the MailSnippet-class. My bad.
	The result of not doing it was that only one copy of the attachment file was printed, and not the correct number.
	I debugged at work, and I commit the changes at howm --oO

1.	Updated all dependencies and modules.
2.	When reading the settings-file there may be an unhandled exception when the file exists, 
	but the it's empty. Solution is to just delete it and create a new one. This happened 
	when the settingsfile was transfered from one PC to another and the printer-queue does not have the same name
	as the previous one. The exception occurs when opening the settings-dialog-box, and we could not actually
	open the dialog box for adding the new settings.
