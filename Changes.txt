Decided to add a progress-bar while connecting and fetching mail from the IMAP-server. Reason for this is that impatient users will 
start to click all ver the place and think something ios wrong if the operation takes time.

The progress-bar is opened in a new windows, and the connect an fetch operation is now in different functions/split up. The operation 
OpenConnectMails(..) is tarted in a new thread/task so I had to rearrange a little bit. It's actually getting a little bit messy. I can
see now that a lot of the solutions can be rearranged. But that's for another time. So there's a new source:
 - WinProgress.xaml.cs 
 - WinProgress.xaml

1.	FilterSubject - RegEx is improved for capturing Norwegian letters using "switch" \p{L}
2.	Change of printers was not updated. The member variables printer_plain and printer_adhessive is now updated when the "Change printer"-button is pressed, 
	and saved to file when "Save&Exit"-button is pressed.

1.	Had to fix a couple of special cases in function FilterSubject, where the user has not put a space between '-' and no of pages.
2.	In same function decided to remove all '-' from the original string.
3.	In same function, there's a special case where user has not put a space between the strings "ordre" and ORDER_NO
4.	In constructor-function for class MailSnippet: had to make special case for when city/place consists of 3 strings. 
5.	Added new function SplitString(a, b) hich splits a string that has been concatenated by user. 
	Example: ordre12345, which should be in the form "ordre 12345", or "12ARK" which should be in the form "12 ARK"

1.	I copied the code from a test-program and forgot to remove the initialization of the variables locally. The variables are member-variables og the MailSnippet-class. My bad.
	The result of not doing it was that only one copy of the attachment file was printed, and not the correct number.
	I debugged at work, and I commit the changes at howm --oO

1.	Added workaround for names consisting of two words(never thought of that)
2.	Added dateformat in case of a formatexception on dateTime.

----------------
1.	Removed module Ghostscript.NET (using pdfium, don't need it)
2.	RemoveNegative is renamed to FilterSubject
3.	Added more functionality to FilterSubject - function. There are situations where sender adds messages after the standard subject. 
	These messages has to be ignored

----------------
1.	Updated all dependencies and modules.
2.	When reading the settings-file there may be an unhandled exception when the file exists, 
	but the it's empty. Solution is to just delete it and create a new one. This happened 
	when the settingsfile was transfered from one PC to another and the printer-queue does not have the same name
	as the previous one. The exception occurs when opening the settings-dialog-box, and we could not actually
	open the dialog box for adding the new settings.
