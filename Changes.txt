1.	FilterSubject is completely changed by using Regex functionality in C# .NET. See source for now.

----------------
-- 2019.09.24 --
----------------
1.	Had to fix a couple of special cases in function FilterSubject, where the user has not put a space between '-' and no of pages.
2.	In same function decided to remove all '-' from the original string.
3.	In same function, there's a special case where user has not put a space between the strings "ordre" and ORDER_NO
4.	In constructor-function for class MailSnippet: had to make special case for when city/place consists of 3 strings. 
5.	Added new function SplitString(a, b) hich splits a string that has been concatenated by user. 
	Example: ordre12345, which should be in the form "ordre 12345", or "12ARK" which should be in the form "12 ARK"

1.	I copied the code from a test-program and forgot to remove the initialization of the variables locally. The variables are member-variables og the MailSnippet-class. My bad.
	The result of not doing it was that only one copy of the attachment file was printed, and not the correct number.
	I debugged at work, and I commit the changes at howm --oO

----------------
1.	Added workaround for names consisting of two words(never thought of that)
2.	Added dateformat in case of a formatexception on dateTime.

----------------
-- 2019.09.11 --
----------------
1.	Removed module Ghostscript.NET (using pdfium, don't need it)
2.	RemoveNegative is renamed to FilterSubject
3.	Added more functionality to FilterSubject - function. There are situations where sender adds messages after the standard subject. 
	These messages has to be ignored

----------------
1.	Updated all dependencies and modules.
2.	When reading the settings-file there may be an unhandled exception when the file exists, 
	but the it's empty. Solution is to just delete it and create a new one. This happened 
	when the settingsfile was transfered from one PC to another and the printer-queue does not have the same name
	as the previous one. The exception occurs when opening the settings-dialog-box, and we could not actually
	open the dialog box for adding the new settings.
